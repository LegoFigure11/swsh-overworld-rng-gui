Special thanks to @Lincoln-LM and the rest of the [PyNXReader](https://github.com/Lincoln-LM/PyNXReader) contributors, as the generator code is largely based off their scripts!
Also credit to @niart120 for [Project_Xe](https://github.com/niart120/Project_Xe) where the motions->state algorithm comes from!
